# faviconfleet
==============

In preparation for the dev releases of chrme and Mozilla last year I resolved to handle the favicon issue with a click as it can easily be the majority of yur time building aps and extensions. Never released because the list never stopped growing, as well I thouhgt it would be well served t be its own app. But JS based not, PHPH and Imagemagick. For now it is what it was a year ago, a largely complete imagemagick script for Ubuntu/debian.
